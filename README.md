## Game Description:
We are building a fishing simulator game, one that tests your memory as the game progresses!

## Simulation Description:
You will be experiencing the life of a fisherman, but you can only catch specific kinds of fish, those kinds are color coded and shown on screen beforehand.

## Currency Used:
Your own memory is the currency of our game! It is finite, and our game's goal is to push your memory to the limit.

## Problem/Question:
We want to see if we can help increase your memory, and that if we can train your memory to perform better than it ever has.

## What Command Pattern:
We will be implimenting a way to manage what spot of the lake you will be fishing in.
